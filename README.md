https://mkliu1013.github.io/03-Experiment/

In this Experiment, we need to test the visual difference between different charts. I selected bar chart,pie chart and treemap
for testing. According to the Cleveland and McGill's research result, we already know bar chart is the most effective way, so it can be used as benchmark for other two charts.

For the flow of design, the first page is the welcome page, it indroduces the experimental objective for participants. Then participants can select disagree or agree with this experiment. Because it may take 15 minutes around to finish the test. If click disagree, it will alert "bye". If click agree, it will go for the instruction page.
